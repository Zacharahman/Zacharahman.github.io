                    <p>
                        College students, faculty, and staff all face difficulty finding parking spots on campus. Our solution is to develop an app that will track how many vehicles enter and exit parking garages and lots on campus.

                        Our team made a collabarative effort to list out the problems, solutions, functionality and people affected as a result of limited campus parking. This diagram helps visualize all ideas within our group to help identify the problem and go about a solution.

                        Created realistic individuals for contextualization of app. People that would likely encounter parking issues and uttilize the app are portrayed here.

                        Teamsketch shows how to use the app from a user perspective. Each team member made a realistic sketch of how the apps interface will look.

                        <h2>Paper Prototype: Campus Parking App</h2></a>
                    <p>
                        This is a paper prototype of how the parking app will look and funciton. This is important to create as it is easy to change a drawing and map of what the app is supposed to look like rather than changing the code.
